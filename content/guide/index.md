## What's this ?

I've been working with Vue for quite a while now. Through my journey, I've learnt many new things and did many mistakes too. This site will be kind of a document-blog thing where I'll share my opinions on how to build good web apps with Vue 3. I'll discuss about project architecture, performance optimizations, common issues and how I fixed them. I hope they'll help someone.

## Is it a list of best practices ?
Nope. Definitely not. As I said, these are just my opinions. These are some lessons that I learnt the hard way, by hit and trail, experimenting, implementing in production apps. So I don't think they can be considered as `best practices`.

## Does it gurrantee best performance and DX
May be and may be not. These are things that worked out for me and my team. We saw better perf. with great DX and I hope they work for you.
